LiftUApp (or whatever)


A truckdriver who needs to better his driving could use LiftUApp, which is an app 
to facilitate a hitchhiking. A driver who has a passenger is proven to concentrate more
on the road rather than distracting things like phones or paperwork etc. The advantage of 
this compared to the hitchhiker taking his own car or public transport is that the hitchhiker both
contributes to the environment and pays most likely nothing, it's a win-win situation.
